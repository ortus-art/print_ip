# print_ip

The main goal of the project is to demonstrate Doxygen generated documentation.

The basis for the documentations is a small sample application that prints IP address. 

## Print IP application

The internal presentation of IP address can be any. The program should transform the data into dot-decimal notation.  For example 3221226219/0xC00002EB and etc. should be presented as 192.0.2.235. If size of data is smaller then present available part of the data.
